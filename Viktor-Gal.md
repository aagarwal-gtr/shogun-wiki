### Shogun

I've started using Shogun in the beginning of my PhD studies, around 2011. Then I've joined to do a GSoC project in 2012 and ever since then I'm just hanging around and trying to add some more functionality and stability to Shogun. My goal now is to get Shogun distributed.

### Ask him about
 * distributed computing, c++ happyinesshacking and anything that is software engineering related
 * automated testing, building and static analysis.
 * get Shogun to compile on Windows
 * introducing an LP/QP framework in Shogun

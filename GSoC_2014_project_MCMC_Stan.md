# Enabling MCMC based inference via Stan

### Mentors
 * Fernando (github: [iglesias](https://github.com/iglesias), IRC: iglesias)
 * Heiko (github: [karlnapf](https://github.com/karlnapf), IRC: HeikoS)

### Difficulty & Requirements
Advanced.
You will need knowledge about:
 * Stan itself, how to use it, basics about its internals
 * Building C++ code and modifying builds
 * MCMC and Bayesian modelling mainly to structure and write documentation
 * Documentation skills
 * Shogun's probabilistic models
 * Optional: Automatic differentiation in Stan

### Description
Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is a fundamental tool for inference in Bayesian models. As Shogun contains a number of models that fall in the category, we would like to enable MCMC based inference for them. Stan is the de-facto standard for defining real valued models and perform automatic inference for them via a state-of-the-art Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampler. We would like to use Stan from within Shogun

### Shogun

I've been involved with Shogun since GSoC 2011 with the next stop at GSoC 2012 and consequent two years being a mentor. As a student I've been working on dimensionality reduction and multitask learning with the help of Christian Widmer. Since 2013 I am helping to mentor various GSoC projects of Shogun.

##  SWIG
Compiling modular interfaces more and more gets a problem. Both compile time and memory requirements explode with more classes added to Shogun. Furthermore, the SWIG magic might be very interesting for other projects, so it could be a good idea to pull it out from the Shogun source tree into a seperate mini-project.

 * Clean up ```SGVector``` and similar
 * Wrapper/Impl classes?

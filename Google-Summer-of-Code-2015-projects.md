# A (yet incomplete and to be polished) list of potential GSoC 2015 projects.
Please create a new wiki page for each project that you describe (to keep this page small). Name them as "GSoC_2014_project_MCMC" etc.

## Ideas to port from last year's list:
 * [MCMC & Stan](GSoC_2014_project_MCMC_Stan)
 * LP/QP optimisation framework.
 * Native Windows port.

## New ideas for which we need descriptions:
 * Linalg framework.
 * Deep learning 2?
 * Fundamental ML algorithms 2? (such as?).

## Other ideas:
 * Cool pipelines
   * A kaggle pipeline for supervised prediction.
   * Spectrometer (there is an open-source hardward project on this)
   * Music brainz predictions (The cool hair guy at GSoC is the one we should talk to here)
   * Some bio thing?
   * Collaboration with MLPack for toolkit wide performance/accuracy testing

## Infrastructure:
 * Easy Model selection!
 * Easy linalg
 * Get rid of static interfaces, migrate all tests etc
 * Matlab swig bindings

## Clean ups:
 * Modularise Shogun
 * Replace parameter framework
 * Benchmark existing algos and improve!

# Implement a REST interface for machine learning

### Mentors
 * Sergey (github: [lisitsyn](https://github.com/lisitsyn), IRC: lisitsyn)
 * Soeren (github: [sonney2k](https://github.com/sonney2k), IRC: sonney2k)

### Difficulty & Requirements

Not difficult but requires careful design.

### Description

We believe in the post-web 2.0 world there is a need for REST based simple protocol for simple machine learning tasks

### Details
Write about details of the project here.

### Waypoints and initial work
 * Choose a good embedded web server to handle requests and integrate it to the Shogun codebase 

### Optional
Make a cool demo.

### Why this is cool
This project considers implementing first well-known major implementation of REST-based machine learning which could be very useful for researchers and engineers around the world.

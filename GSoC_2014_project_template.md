# Density Estimation in Infinite Dimensional Exponential Families

(I know it sounds ridiculously complicated, but it *is* quite cool!)

### Mentors
 * Heiko (github: [karlnapf](https://github.com/karlnapf), IRC: HeikoS)

### Difficulty & Requirements
Medium.
The mathematics behind this are very interesting, though not absolutely necessary to implement the algorithms, which are quite simple.

You need knowledge of:
 * Kernel methods in general
 * Density estimation basics
 * Basic (math+numerical) linear algebra. In particular linear systems
 * Come C++ knowledge, including designing class hierarchies

### Description
This project is about implementing a new form of density estimation

### Details
Write about details of the project here.

### Waypoints and initial work
 * Step 1
 * Step 2
 * ...

### Optional
Parts of the project that would be cool once the core is finished.

### Why this is cool
Motivation to get involved here.

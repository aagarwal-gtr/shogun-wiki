shogun features wishlist:
 
*  OpenMP support
*  replace SG_REF + SG_UNREF with smart pointers (maybe c++11?)
*  support for drop-in replacement for std malloc (memory managment). e.g. jemalloc
*  thread pool
*  add CSGObject::clone() that implements clone() for all the derived classes
*  implement baseline ML algorithms that are almost in every other ML library are available
*  documention/howto/examples for each and every algorithm we have in shogun. the examples preferable implemented in python

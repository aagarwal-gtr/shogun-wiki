# Deep learning

### Mentors
 * Theofanis Karaletsos
 * Sergey (github: [lisitsyn](https://github.com/lisitsyn), IRC: lisitsyn)

### Difficulty & Requirements

Pretty difficult. Requires:

 * C++ programming
 * Understanding what neural nets are and how do we learn them
 * OpenCL programming is a plus

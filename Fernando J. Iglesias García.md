### Personal
Occupation: Marie Curie research fellow at [Thales Nederland](www.thalesgroup.com/en/homepage/netherlands) and PhD student at [the University of Twente](http://www.utwente.nl/en/), associated with [the faculty of EEMCS](http://www.utwente.nl/en/education/eemcs/).
Research interests: statistical signal processing and information fusion. Mainly, the application of Bayesian statistics and Monte Carlo methods to target tracking.
Other interests: machine learning in education and open source, the amazing evolution of robotics, competitive programming as a tool to improve problem solving skills, fitness, travel, and video games.

### Shogun
Fernando got involved in Shogun back at the beginning of 2012 with the goal of becoming a GSoC student, which he did, starting [Shogun's framework for structured output learning](http://iglesiashogun.wordpress.com/2012/05/22/first-weekly-report-gsoc-2012/) under the supervision of [Nico GÃ¶rnitz](http://www.user.tu-berlin.de/nico.goernitz/) and [Georg Zeller](http://www.bork.embl.de/~zeller/).

At the end of 2012 and during the first half of 2013, Fernando used Shogun for his [undergraduate thesis work](www.iglesias.github.io/linal/) on structured output learning applied to label sequence learning and learning of general structured output models (aka graphs). The latter part was the precursor of GSoC 2013 project developed by @hushell and mentored by [Patrick Pletscher](www.pletscher.org).

During the summer of 2013, Fernando implemented in Shogun the metric learning algorithm known as [Large Margin Nearest Neighbours](http://www.cse.wustl.edu/~kilian/code/lmnn/lmnn.html) (LMNN) and applied it to a [metagenomics data set](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/gist/iglesias/6576096). This work was performed under the supervision of Georg Zeller.
